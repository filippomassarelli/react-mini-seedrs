## Get started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, open your terminal and make sure you have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine:

```
$ node -v
v14.15.4
```

We will also be using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) as our test runner so check you have it:

```
$ jest -v
26.6.3
```

The Mini Seedrs user interface is built to communicate with our APIs, which for now are only available if install our back-end app locally. So make sure you have either [docker-mini-seedrs](https://github.com/filippomassarelli/docker-mini-seedrs) or plain [mini-seedrs](https://github.com/filippomassarelli/mini-seedrs) repository cloned and their prerequisites installed.


### Install and Run

First `cd` to your cloned Mini Seedrs back-end app and launch the server.

Then open another terminal window to clone this repo and `cd` into the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/filippomassarelli/react-mini-seedrs.git
cd react-mini-seedrs
```

You should see the following folder structure:
```

    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ search
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ search.test.js
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.jsx

        â”œâ”€â”€ InvestPage.jsx
        â””â”€â”€ Tab.jsxNotFoundPage.jsx
```

Now install the project dependencies using node package manager:
```
npm install
```

Check that the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules` folder has been added to the projects's root directory.

Finally, run the start script with:
```
npm run start
```

If it doesn't do so automatically, open a browser tab and navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the app.

And that's it, you are running Mini Seedrs in development mode :rocket:


### Test

All our React Components have an accompanying suite of basic tests to minimise regression.

Run the test script in the terminal:

```
npm test
```

You should expect 12 test suites comprising of a total of 36 tests to pass:

```
Test Suites: 12 passed, 12 total
Tests:       36 passed, 36 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        22.84 s
Ran all test suites.
```
Jest will keep on running in the interactive watch mode, type `q` if you want to quit.

Testing is awesome, however this project only scratches the surface of react component testing, especially for our stateful components. 

If you are a test wizard and feel like [contributing](#contributing) you are very welcome Sir ðŸ§™

## Built with

### Tools and libraries

The Mini Seedrs user interface has been bootstrapped with the help of the [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) toolchain and the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library.   

### Technologies

The major technologies are:

- React JS
- React Router
- React Hooks

Future work would include moving our components to Typescript, and centralise state management with Redux. 

### Features

Features of this UI include:

- Darkmode 
- Responsive design
- Search functionality in the navbar
- Random campaign recommendation in the banner
- Filtered rows navigation inspired by Netflix:copyright:
- User friendly dialog box with investment functionality 
- Informative snackbar alerts for invalid investments or searches
- Successful investment confirmation with social sharing
